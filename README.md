Here's a backend README specifically designed for your **Foodly App** with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Stripe integration:

---

# 🍔 **Foodly App Backend** 🍕

Welcome to the **Foodly App Backend**, where all the magic happens! This backend serves as the core of the **Foodly** app, handling user authentication, restaurant management, order processing, payment integration, and more. The backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express**, and uses **MongoDB** to store all necessary data. It also integrates **Stripe** for secure payment processing.

---

## ⚙️ **Tech Stack**

- **Backend Framework:** **Express.js** (Node.js framework for RESTful APIs)
- **Database:** **MongoDB** (NoSQL database to store restaurant data, user profiles, orders)
- **Authentication:** **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens for secure user login and registration)
- **Payment Gateway:** **Stripe** (For secure payments)
- **Environment Variables:** Used to securely store sensitive information such as MongoDB URI, Stripe keys, and JWT secret.

---

## 🔧 **Installation & Setup**

### **Backend Setup**

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ShubhamKrishna0/foodly_flutter_backend.git
    cd foodly-app/backend
    ```

2. **Install backend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables** in the `.env` file for MongoDB, Stripe, and JWT secrets:

    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the backend project and add the following:

    ```env
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    ```

4. **Start the backend server**:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The backend will be up and running at `http://localhost:5000`.

## 🛠️ **Backend Endpoints**

### **1. Restaurants**

- **GET /restaurants:** Get a list of all available restaurants.
- **POST /restaurants:** Add a new restaurant (admin only).
- **GET /restaurants/:id:** Get details of a single restaurant.
- **PUT /restaurants/:id:** Update a restaurant's details (admin only).
- **DELETE /restaurants/:id:** Remove a restaurant (admin only).

### **2. Orders**

- **POST /orders:** Place a new order.
- **GET /orders:** Get all orders (for users and admins).
- **GET /orders/:id:** Get details of a specific order.
- **PUT /orders/:id:** Update order status (admin only).

### **3. Users**

- **POST /users/register:** Register a new user.
- **POST /users/login:** Log in an existing user.

---

## 🔐 **Authentication & Authorization**

Foodly uses **JWT-based authentication** to secure user login and registration. Here's how it works:

1. **User Registration:** Users can sign up by providing an email and password. The backend generates a JWT token upon successful registration.
2. **User Login:** For existing users, the backend validates the credentials and returns a JWT token for subsequent requests.
3. **JWT Tokens:** Once logged in, the client stores the token (in local storage or secure storage) and sends it with each request to access protected routes (e.g., placing an order, viewing profile).
4. **Authorization:** For certain routes, such as placing an order or updating restaurant details, a valid JWT token must be included in the request header.

---

## 💳 **Payment Integration (Stripe)**

**Stripe** is used to handle secure payments. Here's how it works:

1. **Frontend:** The user selects their payment method, and Stripe’s frontend SDK securely handles the transaction.
2. **Backend:** The backend processes the payment by making a request to Stripe’s API using the secret key stored in the `.env` file.

### Payment Flow:

1. User initiates payment on the frontend.
2. A payment request is sent to the backend.
3. Backend communicates with Stripe to confirm payment.
4. If successful, the order is marked as paid and the user receives confirmation.
